# CSharp-ATM-Console-App
This is a small C# App that I made around first year using Visual Studio 2017. I decided to post it on GitHub. Use Visual Studio to create and run a C# ATM Console Application.  

In this application, a user can:
- Log in using your ATM card number and PIN
- Check account balance
- Deposit money
- Transfer money
- Check statement of account and logout.
